# Help & Support

Resuminator is proudly a community driven software, which means that we build what our community tells us they want and
they help us maintain the software with their open source contributions or feedback.

Since 04 June, 2023, we provide support for any of your queries through email only!

**Email** - The classic way to reach out for any other queries. Email your query or proposal at [hello@resuminator.in](mailto:hello@resuminator.in)
